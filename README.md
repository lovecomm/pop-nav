# Pop Nav
Navigation that is duplicated and fixed when scrolling back up, hides when scrolling down, and is removed when scrolled back to the top of the page.

Bootstrap (Sass), jQuery, and Waypoints are the only dependencies.

This repo is not setup to be working out of the box. It's meant to be plugged into an existing Bootstrap project, in which you would like the pop-nav functionality.

Stylesheet & HTML are there for reference. Just be sure to use the same classes and IDs in your HTML & Stylesheet files. These are used by the nav-pop.js, and are necessary for the functionality.
